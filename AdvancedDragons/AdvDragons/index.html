                Heroes of Might and Magic is a series of video games originally created and developed by New World Computing.
                As part of the Might and Magic franchise, the series changed ownership when NWC was acquired by 3DO...
            </p>
            <p>
        The game is known for its deep turn-based strategy mechanics, rich fantasy world, and iconic soundtrack.

            The next shipments of the board game Heroes III from Archon Studio are being delivered. This time, these are copies ordered during the second Kickstarter campaign as part of the so-called "legacy shipment", so this applies to the base game and add-ons developed for the first campaign. The add-ons Wrota Element√≥w, Przysta≈Ñ, Twierdza and the special Sea Battles add-on will be delivered in the fall (September was announced, but this may still change). In the meantime, you can already familiarize yourself with the content of these add-ons by downloading the mission notebooks, also available on our website in the Download section. For now, these materials are only available in English. Therefore, we have updated the Map Locations section with planned new objects. Their descriptions may change slightly when the official Polish translation is available.

            </h2>
            <p>
With undisguised joy and excitement I would like to invite you all to the DUBBING CONTEST announced a long time ago.This is not just any contest, it's a double one! In addition to the opportunity to become the voice of one of the 7 heroes of the Horn of the Abyss campaign, you will also have a chance to get into Might and Magic VI: Mandate of Heaven - a game that has never had an official Polish language version. It's time to change that and enrich the fan-made Polonization of Kwasowa Grota. Here, there will be... as many as 50 voices to cast, minimum! In total, at least 12 female voices and 45 male voices are needed.

                    In Heroes of Might and Magic III, the Black Dragon is one of the most powerful and iconic creatures in the game, especially renowned in the Dungeon faction. Here's a breakdown of what makes the Black Dragon so special:</li>
